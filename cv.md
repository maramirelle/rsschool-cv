# CV-1

## Let me introduce myself
My name is Maryia Piatrenka. It's OK to call me Marylya or maramirelle.

## How to contact me
- Discord: maramirelle

## About myself
I'm a comunicative person. As a teatcher, I've got used to understanding the others even if it's the person I really don't like.

I'm good at creating magical realms and writing about them. I hope that my unstoppable fantasy will help me in my work.

I do adore studying, especially I'm kin of language studies. Code is also language (even a groop of languages), that's why I'm sure that I'll manage:) 

## My skills
*Pascal ABC, I guess?*

Seriously, I'm only at the beginning of my coding journey. I studied Pascal ABC and HTML basics at school and my teacher said I was good at it.

## Code examples
*just crying*

```

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<script>
let userName = prompt('Как тебя зовут?', 'Впиши своё имя сюда');
alert (`Тебя зовут ${userName}`);
</script>
</body>
</html>

```

## My expirience
*I have a funny joke on this topic...*



## My education
I've graduated from BSU, Philological faculty where I've been studying the Belarussian language and literature. My diploma project was about dialect issues of the 17th century literature.

I also have a diploma of church choir director (*I'm a real collector of strange educational courses, yeah*).

Now I'm studying programming at RS School.

## English level
Accourding to the test, my English level is C1, but I guess it's something between B2 and C1 actually.
